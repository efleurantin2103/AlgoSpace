# MATH 689 - Computer Assisted Proofs

This repository contains MATLAB code demonstrations developed for MATH 689 at George Mason University (Spring 2024). The code focuses on implementing rigorous numerical methods, particularly the radii polynomial approach for computer-assisted proofs in dynamical systems.

## Contents

* `ClassDemo_RadiiPoly`: Basic implementation of the radii polynomial method
* `ClassDemo_RadiiPoly3_intval`: Implementation with interval arithmetic
* `ClassDemo_RadiiPoly_CRTBP`: Application to the Circular Restricted Three Body Problem
* `ClassDemo_RadiiPoly_Inf`: Extended implementation for infinite-dimensional problems
* `ClassDemo_RadiiPoly_Lorenz`: Application to the Lorenz system

## Note

This is a work in progress. Additional code examples and documentation will be added at a later date.
